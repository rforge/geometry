CHANGES IN VERSION 0.2-0  - Released 2011/08/24

NEW FEATURES

 * The tsearch and tsearchn functions have been ported from
   Octave. These functions have the same syntax as the Octave
   versions, though it also possible to get tsearch to output
   barycentric coordinates. tsearch only works for 2D simplexes
   (i.e. triangles), but is fast because it is written in C. By
   default, tsearchn uses the fast tsearch function when presented
   with 2D data.
